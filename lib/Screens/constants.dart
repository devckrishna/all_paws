    "The unconditional love of an animal is one of the best feelings. An animal will bring years of happiness, laughs, kisses, hugs and love. When the time comes to add a pet to a family, adopting from a local animal shelter is a better option instead of buying from a private breeder. An animal adopted from a local animal shelter obtains a second chance of life instead of dying like the three million euthanised animals. Adoption gives an animal a second chance at life to find a forever home and helps with the control of animal overpopulation. \n";
